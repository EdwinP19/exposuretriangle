            Increasing the ISO essentially allows you to work with less light. As always, though, there’s a tradeoff: 
            increased ISOs result in increased noise and less detail. Noise is the result of random fluctuations in an electrical signal. 
            At lower ISOs, the magnitude of the image signal is large relative to the noise (signal to noise ratio), meaning the noise generally remains unobtrusive. 
            When working at higher ISOs, the image signal is generally close in magnitude to that of the noise and thus, noise enters the image.
            <br><br>
            Think of the image signal and noise as a pit of balls. If my image signal is 1,000 balls, I won’t notice if noise adds 4 or 5 balls to the bunch. 
            If my image signal is small though, say 10 balls, it will be very noticeable if noise adds 5 balls to the bunch. 
            When I amplify that signal through the use of a high ISO, the relatively high level of noise will be amplified considerably too. 
            When high ISO makes the 10 balls into 1,000 balls again, the noise suddenly becomes 500 balls.

            So, why ever use a high ISO? Often, when working in lower light, you will find yourself at a point where you are using the widest possible aperture and the slowest shutter speed you can to stop action. 
            At this point, your only choice is to increase the ISO. The lens cannot physically open itself any wider and as discussed above, 
            sacrificing sharpness for a slower shutter speed is rarely advisable. I would rather have a grainy image that shows a well-defined subject than a smoother image with a subject lost in blur.
