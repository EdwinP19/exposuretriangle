            Shutter speed is a measure of how long the shutter remains open and thus, how long the sensor is exposed to light. 
            Faster shutter speeds give the sensor less time to collect light and thus, result in a lower exposure. 
            Slower shutter speeds allow more time for the sensor to collect light and result in a higher exposure.

            In this case, the reason we might want to use a higher shutter speed is to stop motion, whether that be camera shake or a subject that is moving, 
            allowing us to maintain sharpness. Remember, as long as the shutter is open, the camera is essentially recording the position of elements in the frame; 
            if one of those elements moves, the result will often be undesired blurriness.

            Many photographers will argue that this is the most important aspect, saying if your shutter speed isn’t fast enough to give you a sharp image, 
            nothing else will save the image. In general, I agree.
