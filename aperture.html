        <p>Aperture is a measure of how open or closed the lensâ€™ iris is. 
            A wider aperture (or lower f-number) means more light will be let in by the lens, 
            simply because the opening is larger. A narrower aperture (or higher f-number) allows less light to reach the sensor.
            You might wonder why we would ever want less light to reach the sensor.

            The answer the majority of the time is that we want a larger depth of field. 
            Depth of field is a byproduct of aperture. Narrower apertures (higher f-numbers) give a greater depth of field, 
            allowing more of a scene to be in focus (think landscapes). Wider apertures (lower f-numbers) create a narrow depth of field, 
            which can help isolate a subject and is one of the greatest compositional tools at your disposal (think portraiture).

            You should also note that most lenses are their sharpest around f/5.6 or f/8. 
            However, many photographers are willing to trade some sharpness for the subject-isolating effects of a wider aperture.
